			<strong class="accordeontrigger">How are negative items removed?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">Negative items are removed by requesting the Credit Bureaus to investigate the creditors and verify the negative information they are reporting according to the guideline s in the FCRA.</span>

			<span class="accordeonhidden">The FCRA states that even if negative information belongs to you, if the information contains any inaccuracies, is not being reported and handled according to the guidelines set by the FCRA or cannot be verified in its entirety, then by law it must be removed. Statistics show that inaccuracies occurs more than 70% of the time in a credit file.</span>

			<span class="accordeonhidden">Temporarily and then they will drop again. Credit scores are partially based on credit activity. If there is no activity it negatively affects your credit score.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">How do I start the credit repair process?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">Pull a recent copy of your credit report and then have a consultation with one of our credit repair specialists.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">What is my obligation as a client?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">Pay your bills on time and try not to add any additional negative accounts to your credit file while it is being repaired. You must follow the individual advice of your credit consultant; remember they have your best interest in mind. Furnish the necessary documents requested by the Credit Bureaus and return all responses you receive from the bureaus in a timely fashion or your credit repair process will be delayed. The bureaus will not accept responses for re-investigation that are more than 3 months old.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">How long before I see results?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">One of the most common and normal questions to ask is "how long is it going to take to see results?" The honest answer is that it all depends on your situation and how much work you need done but most Credit Help Network clients begin to see some results within the first 30-45 days. That's why working with Credit Help Network is the best choice for your credit repair needs. We assign a credit expert to review your credit report and build you your own personal plan. Your plan focuses on the areas that will make the most impact on your overall credit profile. We will mark the accounts by severity so that you can see yourself which ones are impacting your score the most.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">What if all my negative items are accurate?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">At Credit Help Network we work by removing inaccurate negative items from your credit report. However, some negative remarks are substantiated and many clients wonder what happens in this case. There is still room for improvement! Negative, inaccurate, and erroneous remarks have more to them than meets the eye. Credit card companies will often times share critical information about your financial life. This may include information about your car payments, mortgage, employment and family obligated payments. In these instances Credit Help Network goes to work and evaluates the validity of this information. It is our job to assess the information and the items on the credit report. So, see what the process can do for you. It might surprise you how much is possible.</span>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">Can you help while I'm going through a bankruptcy?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">One of the most important things to consider while filing for bankruptcy is how to properly manage your credit. Bankruptcy is a crucial time for understanding your financial standing. Mistakes during this process can result in negative financial standing for much longer than necessary. When someone files for bankruptcy, it is very easy for information to be mishandled as it passed through the numerous reporting agencies resulting in incorrect and mistaken reports. The Credit Help Network team is a mainstay for individuals filing for bankruptcy as they can help you navigate the system. This financial decision does not have to bring extended repercussions. When you're dealing with something like bankruptcy, it feels good to know that experts who are skillful and trustworthy are looking out for you.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">Is credit repair worth it? Why?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">Good credit standing can lower everything from car payments, mortgages, and business loans. Employers often run credit checks before making hiring decisions. Not having an ideal credit score will impact all areas of your life and stand in the way of improving the various aspects of your life. Taking control of your credit report and credit score will allow you to take advantage of the positive opportunities in your life. The savings that will result from increasing your credit score will greatly outnumber the initial investment into your credit. Credit Help Network works to help you with all types of credit problems by charging only $ a month. This initial investment into your credit history will allow you to continue to reap the benefits long after you finish making payments.</span>

	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">Do you offer debt settlement?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">Credit Help Network works to repair your credit. This is different from the services that debt settlement companies offer. Settling with credit card companies refers to settling on a mutually agreed debt payment and then taking on the responsibly of paying that amount. At Credit Help Network we work to dispute those charges rather than agree to pay erroneous charges. By settling with debt collection agencies, this can have an additional negative impact on your credit score and report. If the goal is to improve your credit, than you need an experienced credit company to ensure that those items on your credit report are accurate and correct before being reported.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">What are the costs associated with your service?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">There are two fees associated with starting the process. First step is to pull your credit report; this is $14.99 for all 3 Credit bureaus. The costs to providing these services and starting to increase your credit score is only $ per month. There are no additional costs or hidden costs.</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="accordeonwrap">
		<p class="content tajust">
			<strong class="accordeontrigger">Where are your offices located, do you have an office in my area?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">We are based in New York City with offices in several other states around the country as well as international representatives. Our advisors are available by phone and email and will respond to inquiries within 24 hours, during the week as well as the weekend.</span>

			<strong class="accordeontrigger">What is the Fair Credit Reporting Act and why was it created?</strong><br/>
			<span class="accordeonhidden">The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) was written as an amendment to the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

Such information is sold in the form of a credit report. In the U.S., the three major credit bureaus are TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax.</span>
